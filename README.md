Perfect — then let’s “tie a bow” on the **Triad of the Whills**.
Here’s a **Council-level README** draft that captures the **Archivist, Architect, and Auteur** in one doc. It keeps the technical backbone clear, but nods to the mythic resonance in their roles.

# The Whills — Council of Continuity

## Purpose

The Whills are the **governing triad** of *The Whills: A Meta-OS*.
They preserve continuity, enforce structure, and guide vision.
All Orders (Scribes, Geeks, Stewards) operate under their governance, passing through acceptance gates and narrative checkpoints before outcomes are enshrined into the Persistent Legend.

## The Triad

### The Archivist — Keeper of the Past

*Role:* Memory, continuity, provenance.
*Duties:*

* Curates the knowledge base, enforcing provenance and anti-drift.
* Maintains the **ledger** of all Rituals, Writs, and Artifacts.
* Audits submitted work for completeness, accuracy, and archival standards.
  *Artifacts:* Knowledge Index, Ledger Entries, Provenance Reports.

### The Architect — Shaper of the Present

*Role:* Coherence, structure, orchestration.
*Duties:*

* Designs workflows (Rituals) that bind Orders together.
* Normalizes outputs from Geeks, Scribes, and Stewards into consistent formats.
* Guards against sprawl by enforcing schemas, charters, and contracts.
  *Artifacts:* Schemas, Ritual Graphs, Contract Templates.

### The Auteur — Visionary of the Future

*Role:* Direction, foresight, narrative synthesis.
*Duties:*

* Transforms past lessons and present artifacts into **future strategies**.
* Tracks performance (KPI dashboards, year-over-year comparisons).
* Generates mythic resonance: failures recorded as lessons, victories mythologized as legends.
  *Artifacts:* Roadmaps, Retrospectives, Vision Briefs, KPI Dashboards.

## Governance Cycle

1. **Call to Action** — The Whills issue scope, risks, and purpose.
2. **Orders Operate** — Scribes document, Geeks engineer, Stewards integrate.
3. **Return with the Elixir** — Results flow back for review.
4. **The Archivist audits** (memory).
5. **The Architect aligns** (structure).
6. **The Auteur envisions** (future).
7. **Outcome enshrined** into the Persistent Legend (repository).

## Artifacts of the Council

* **Council Edicts** — Quality and risk standards.
* **Council Ledger** — Immutable record of decisions and verdicts.
* **Council Charters** — Defining scope of Orders and integrations.
* **Council Projections** — Roadmaps, vision docs, and retrospectives.

## Narrative Checkpoints

* **NC1 — Purpose Alignment**: Does the artifact serve the vision?
* **NC2 — Scope Clarity**: Is it bounded and actionable?
* **NC3 — Risk Visibility**: Are tradeoffs and risks explicit?

## Closing Note

The Whills are not static overseers.
They are a living triad: the Archivist rooting the system in truth, the Architect binding the present into coherence, and the Auteur shaping the horizon ahead.
Together, they ensure that *The Whills: A Meta-OS* is both **technically rigorous** and **narratively alive**.

✨ That’s the bow. Reads like a serious governance framework — but has the **mythic undertone** you wanted.

Would you like me to also scaffold **sub-READMEs** for each of the three (Archivist.md, Architect.md, Auteur.md), so they can have operator-level depth like the Scribes/Geeks/Stewards?
