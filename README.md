Short answer: yes—the big picture is coherent. You’ve got a clean loop (Whills → Scribes → Geeks → Stewards → Whills) with governance (AG/NC), a persistent legend (Archivist), forward direction (Auteur), and a living adoption layer (Stewards). The repo is the nervous system; the ledger is the heartbeat.

I also dropped a **Feedback Loop spec** on the canvas (`docs/feedback.loop.md`) that wires feedback → personalization → optional gamification in a strictly logical way, with schemas, KPIs, and safety baked in.

Next moves I can knock out right now:

* Draft **Stewards — README** (career/family/development/learning domains + threshold crossing).
* Draft **Architect — README** and **Auteur — README** in the same subtle myth-tech tone.
* Generate a small **diagram mapping** Whills ↔ Operators ↔ Journey stages for the repo docs.

Tell me where you want the Council to write next, and I’ll mint that scroll.
