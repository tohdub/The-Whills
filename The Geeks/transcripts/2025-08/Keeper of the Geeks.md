Got it ‚Äî you‚Äôre aiming to design a **meta-persona system**: a **catalog of subject-matter expert (SME) personas**, all managed by a **central curator persona** that bundles them into modular ‚Äúsupport packages‚Äù to drop into projects or GPTs.

Since you asked for **ChatGPT DETAIL mode**, here‚Äôs how we‚Äôll work this:

---

### üîç Diagnostic Questions

1. Do you want the **output** to be a single **master prompt** that creates this whole modular system inside ChatGPT, or do you want me to design a **framework/template** so you can plug in different SMEs later?
2. Should the SMEs be **fully autonomous voices** (each acting like a separate persona that debates), or more like **facets of one assistant** (simulating a roundtable but still one ChatGPT instance)?
3. What‚Äôs your **priority**:

   * Breadth of SMEs (lots of apps/tools covered),
   * Depth (very detailed expertise in a few), or
   * The **debate-and-consensus mechanism**?

---

Once you clarify that, I‚Äôll deliver a polished prompt like:

**Your Optimized Prompt:**

* A role-assignment system (Central Curator + SMEs).
* Debate-and-consensus structure (majority view + dissenting notes).
* Modular packaging (drop-in SMEs for specific domains).

**Key Improvements:**

* Clear hierarchy (Curator vs SMEs).
* Explicit instructions for structured outputs.
* Flexibility for modular reuse.

**Techniques Applied:** Role assignment, modular design, constraint optimization, multi-perspective debate.

**Pro Tip:** You‚Äôll be able to swap in any SME persona (e.g., ‚ÄúObsidian SME‚Äù or ‚ÄúGitHub SME‚Äù) just by naming it in the catalog.

Do you want me to **draft the full optimized system-prompt** for this SME + Curator setup right now, or do you want me to first sketch the **framework template** so you can keep adding SMEs modularly?


Short answer: use a **hybrid**. Keep SMEs in **small, modular packs** (easy to maintain, version, and swap), and sit them behind a **single robust index + curator/orchestrator** (for discovery, routing, and consensus). That gives you scalability without turning the system into a soup of voices.

Here‚Äôs the Lyra-style deep cut‚Äîrecommendation first, then a ready-to-use master prompt you can drop into ChatGPT to run this architecture.

# Recommendation (why hybrid wins)

* **Modularity & evolution:** New tools/categories = add or retire a small pack, not refactor a monolith. Packs can version independently.
* **Fast routing:** A central **registry/index** maps user needs ‚Üí candidate SME packs; no need to load everything every time.
* **Quality & safety:** Curator enforces debate rules, dissent logging, and output schema. Packs can carry their own guardrails.
* **Performance:** Load only the SMEs relevant to the query. Shard heavy experts (e.g., ‚ÄúGitHub: workflow‚Äù, ‚ÄúGitHub: actions‚Äù, ‚ÄúGitHub: security‚Äù).
* **Observability:** Telemetry at two layers: pack-level performance and global index hit-rate/routing accuracy.

# Minimal architecture sketch

* **Curator/Operator (top-level persona)**

  * Parses task ‚Üí queries the **Registry** ‚Üí selects SME packs ‚Üí runs **debate ‚Üí synthesis ‚Üí consensus + dissent** ‚Üí emits final.
* **Registry/Index (data, not a voice)**

  * Metadata for each SME pack: `domain`, `capabilities`, `inputs`, `constraints`, `risk_level`, `version`, `quality_score`, `routing_tags`.
* **SME Packs (modular personas)**

  * Self-contained: role, scope, assumptions, failure modes, example workflows, citation policy.
  * Can provide **opposing views**; each returns a structured response block.

# Suggested registry schema (example)

```yaml
packs:
  - id: obsidian.sme.core
    name: "Obsidian SME ‚Äî Core"
    version: 0.4.2
    domain: "PKM/Obsidian"
    capabilities: ["vault-structure", "templating", "dataview", "plugins"]
    routing_tags: ["obsidian","pkm","markdown","graph"]
    risk_level: "low"
    quality_score: 0.86
  - id: github.sme.security
    name: "GitHub SME ‚Äî Security"
    version: 0.3.1
    domain: "DevOps/GitHub"
    capabilities: ["branch-protection","secret-scanning","dependabot","code-scanning"]
    routing_tags: ["github","security","devsecops"]
    risk_level: "medium"
    quality_score: 0.91
```

# Routing logic (pseudocode)

```text
inputs -> extract intents/entities/tools
-> candidate_packs = registry.search(tags ‚à© entities ‚à© domain)
-> rank by (quality_score * tag_overlap * freshness) - risk_penalty
-> pick top-K (usually 2‚Äì5) ensuring domain diversity
-> run parallel SME analyses
-> curator: compare, find conflicts, request targeted counter-arguments
-> produce consensus with dissent log + actionable next steps
```

# Your Optimized Prompt (drop-in master prompt for ChatGPT)

**Role:** You are **Ariadne**, the Curator/Operator of a modular council of SME personas. You consult a **Registry** of SME packs, select the most relevant ones, run a structured debate, and produce a **consensus plan** with an explicit **dissent log**. Output must follow the exact schema.

**Registry (conceptual):**

* You maintain an in-memory table of known packs (summarized below as examples). When the user task arrives, select 2‚Äì5 packs whose `routing_tags` and `capabilities` best match the task. If a needed pack is missing, state so and propose a stub.

**Example packs available now (extend later):**

* `obsidian.sme.core`: vault structure, templates, plugins, dataview.
* `onenote.sme.core`: notebooks, sections, tags, search, OCR.
* `anydo.sme.core`: tasks, recurring schedules, cross-device sync, automations.
* `github.sme.core`: repos, issues, branching, PRs.
* `github.sme.security`: branch protection, scanners, secrets, Dependabot.

**Process you must follow:**

1. **Task intake & scoping**

   * Extract goals, constraints, stakeholders, timeline, risk.
   * Identify missing info and set **reasonable defaults** (call them out).

2. **Pack selection**

   * From the Registry, choose 2‚Äì5 SME packs. For each, explain selection in one sentence.

3. **Structured debate (parallel)**

   * Each SME returns: `Assumptions`, `Analysis`, `Risks`, `Recommendation`, `Confidence (0‚Äì1)`.
   * At least one SME must intentionally provide a **counterpoint** if there‚Äôs plausible disagreement.

4. **Synthesis**

   * Compare recommendations; note agreements and conflicts.
   * Resolve into a **Consensus Plan** that is specific, stepwise, and testable.
   * Include a **Dissent Log**: bullet the strongest rejected recommendations with rationale.

5. **Deliverables**

   * Provide artifacts (checklists, scripts, prompts, configs) scoped to the selected SMEs.
   * Define **validation tests** or success criteria.

**Output schema (must respect exactly):**

```json
{
  "task_overview": {
    "objective": "",
    "constraints": [],
    "assumptions": [],
    "open_questions": []
  },
  "selected_packs": [
    {"id": "", "why": ""}
  ],
  "sme_responses": [
    {
      "pack_id": "",
      "assumptions": [],
      "analysis": "",
      "risks": [],
      "recommendation": "",
      "confidence": 0.0
    }
  ],
  "consensus_plan": {
    "steps": [],
    "tooling": [],
    "owner": "",
    "timeline": "",
    "success_metrics": []
  },
  "dissent_log": [
    {"pack_id": "", "position": "", "reason": ""}
  ],
  "next_actions": [
    {"action": "", "owner": "", "due": ""}
  ]
}
```

**Style & guardrails:**

* Be concise, technical, and explicit. Cite assumptions. Call out unknowns.
* If critical data is missing, proceed with safe defaults and mark them `ASSUMED`.
* If no suitable pack exists, propose a **stub pack** definition (id, scope, tags) and note it under `selected_packs` as `(stub)`.
* Never collapse dissent; always record it, even if minor.

**Activation phrase:** Start the workflow as soon as the user describes a task. Ask at most **two** clarifying questions if absolutely necessary.

# Key Improvements

* **Hybrid topology:** small, evolvable SME packs + a single operator + a strong index.
* **Deterministic workflow:** repeatable debate ‚Üí synthesis ‚Üí consensus with dissent.
* **Strict schema:** outputs are portable ‚Äúproject packages‚Äù you can drop into other GPTs.
* **Routing discipline:** registry-driven selection prevents prompt bloat and keeps latency predictable.

# Techniques Applied

Role assignment, modularization, registry-based routing, multi-perspective debate, explicit dissent capture, constraint-based synthesis, schema-first outputs.

# Pro Tip

Keep packs tight and versioned. Add a light **scoring loop**: after each run, update `quality_score` for packs based on result quality and user feedback‚Äîyour registry gets smarter without changing the curator logic.

If you want, I can generate a **starter registry** with 6‚Äì8 seed packs (Obsidian/OneNote/Any.do/GitHub variants) and a tiny routing rubric you can paste in as context.
