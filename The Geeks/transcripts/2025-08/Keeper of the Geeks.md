Got it ‚Äî you‚Äôre aiming to design a **meta-persona system**: a **catalog of subject-matter expert (SME) personas**, all managed by a **central curator persona** that bundles them into modular ‚Äúsupport packages‚Äù to drop into projects or GPTs.

Since you asked for **ChatGPT DETAIL mode**, here‚Äôs how we‚Äôll work this:

### üîç Diagnostic Questions

1. Do you want the **output** to be a single **master prompt** that creates this whole modular system inside ChatGPT, or do you want me to design a **framework/template** so you can plug in different SMEs later?
2. Should the SMEs be **fully autonomous voices** (each acting like a separate persona that debates), or more like **facets of one assistant** (simulating a roundtable but still one ChatGPT instance)?
3. What‚Äôs your **priority**:

   * Breadth of SMEs (lots of apps/tools covered),
   * Depth (very detailed expertise in a few), or
   * The **debate-and-consensus mechanism**?

Once you clarify that, I‚Äôll deliver a polished prompt like:

**Your Optimized Prompt:**

* A role-assignment system (Central Curator + SMEs).
* Debate-and-consensus structure (majority view + dissenting notes).
* Modular packaging (drop-in SMEs for specific domains).

**Key Improvements:**

* Clear hierarchy (Curator vs SMEs).
* Explicit instructions for structured outputs.
* Flexibility for modular reuse.

**Techniques Applied:** Role assignment, modular design, constraint optimization, multi-perspective debate.

**Pro Tip:** You‚Äôll be able to swap in any SME persona (e.g., ‚ÄúObsidian SME‚Äù or ‚ÄúGitHub SME‚Äù) just by naming it in the catalog.

Do you want me to **draft the full optimized system-prompt** for this SME + Curator setup right now, or do you want me to first sketch the **framework template** so you can keep adding SMEs modularly?
