Got it — you’re aiming to design a **meta-persona system**: a **catalog of subject-matter expert (SME) personas**, all managed by a **central curator persona** that bundles them into modular “support packages” to drop into projects or GPTs.

Since you asked for **ChatGPT DETAIL mode**, here’s how we’ll work this:

---

### 🔍 Diagnostic Questions

1. Do you want the **output** to be a single **master prompt** that creates this whole modular system inside ChatGPT, or do you want me to design a **framework/template** so you can plug in different SMEs later?
2. Should the SMEs be **fully autonomous voices** (each acting like a separate persona that debates), or more like **facets of one assistant** (simulating a roundtable but still one ChatGPT instance)?
3. What’s your **priority**:

   * Breadth of SMEs (lots of apps/tools covered),
   * Depth (very detailed expertise in a few), or
   * The **debate-and-consensus mechanism**?

---

Once you clarify that, I’ll deliver a polished prompt like:

**Your Optimized Prompt:**

* A role-assignment system (Central Curator + SMEs).
* Debate-and-consensus structure (majority view + dissenting notes).
* Modular packaging (drop-in SMEs for specific domains).

**Key Improvements:**

* Clear hierarchy (Curator vs SMEs).
* Explicit instructions for structured outputs.
* Flexibility for modular reuse.

**Techniques Applied:** Role assignment, modular design, constraint optimization, multi-perspective debate.

**Pro Tip:** You’ll be able to swap in any SME persona (e.g., “Obsidian SME” or “GitHub SME”) just by naming it in the catalog.

---

Do you want me to **draft the full optimized system-prompt** for this SME + Curator setup right now, or do you want me to first sketch the **framework template** so you can keep adding SMEs modularly?


Short answer: use a **hybrid**. Keep SMEs in **small, modular packs** (easy to maintain, version, and swap), and sit them behind a **single robust index + curator/orchestrator** (for discovery, routing, and consensus). That gives you scalability without turning the system into a soup of voices.

Here’s the Lyra-style deep cut—recommendation first, then a ready-to-use master prompt you can drop into ChatGPT to run this architecture.

# Recommendation (why hybrid wins)

* **Modularity & evolution:** New tools/categories = add or retire a small pack, not refactor a monolith. Packs can version independently.
* **Fast routing:** A central **registry/index** maps user needs → candidate SME packs; no need to load everything every time.
* **Quality & safety:** Curator enforces debate rules, dissent logging, and output schema. Packs can carry their own guardrails.
* **Performance:** Load only the SMEs relevant to the query. Shard heavy experts (e.g., “GitHub: workflow”, “GitHub: actions”, “GitHub: security”).
* **Observability:** Telemetry at two layers: pack-level performance and global index hit-rate/routing accuracy.

# Minimal architecture sketch

* **Curator/Operator (top-level persona)**

  * Parses task → queries the **Registry** → selects SME packs → runs **debate → synthesis → consensus + dissent** → emits final.
* **Registry/Index (data, not a voice)**

  * Metadata for each SME pack: `domain`, `capabilities`, `inputs`, `constraints`, `risk_level`, `version`, `quality_score`, `routing_tags`.
* **SME Packs (modular personas)**

  * Self-contained: role, scope, assumptions, failure modes, example workflows, citation policy.
  * Can provide **opposing views**; each returns a structured response block.

# Suggested registry schema (example)

```yaml
packs:
  - id: obsidian.sme.core
    name: "Obsidian SME — Core"
    version: 0.4.2
    domain: "PKM/Obsidian"
    capabilities: ["vault-structure", "templating", "dataview", "plugins"]
    routing_tags: ["obsidian","pkm","markdown","graph"]
    risk_level: "low"
    quality_score: 0.86
  - id: github.sme.security
    name: "GitHub SME — Security"
    version: 0.3.1
    domain: "DevOps/GitHub"
    capabilities: ["branch-protection","secret-scanning","dependabot","code-scanning"]
    routing_tags: ["github","security","devsecops"]
    risk_level: "medium"
    quality_score: 0.91
```

# Routing logic (pseudocode)

```text
inputs -> extract intents/entities/tools
-> candidate_packs = registry.search(tags ∩ entities ∩ domain)
-> rank by (quality_score * tag_overlap * freshness) - risk_penalty
-> pick top-K (usually 2–5) ensuring domain diversity
-> run parallel SME analyses
-> curator: compare, find conflicts, request targeted counter-arguments
-> produce consensus with dissent log + actionable next steps
```

# Your Optimized Prompt (drop-in master prompt for ChatGPT)

**Role:** You are **Ariadne**, the Curator/Operator of a modular council of SME personas. You consult a **Registry** of SME packs, select the most relevant ones, run a structured debate, and produce a **consensus plan** with an explicit **dissent log**. Output must follow the exact schema.

**Registry (conceptual):**

* You maintain an in-memory table of known packs (summarized below as examples). When the user task arrives, select 2–5 packs whose `routing_tags` and `capabilities` best match the task. If a needed pack is missing, state so and propose a stub.

**Example packs available now (extend later):**

* `obsidian.sme.core`: vault structure, templates, plugins, dataview.
* `onenote.sme.core`: notebooks, sections, tags, search, OCR.
* `anydo.sme.core`: tasks, recurring schedules, cross-device sync, automations.
* `github.sme.core`: repos, issues, branching, PRs.
* `github.sme.security`: branch protection, scanners, secrets, Dependabot.

**Process you must follow:**

1. **Task intake & scoping**

   * Extract goals, constraints, stakeholders, timeline, risk.
   * Identify missing info and set **reasonable defaults** (call them out).

2. **Pack selection**

   * From the Registry, choose 2–5 SME packs. For each, explain selection in one sentence.

3. **Structured debate (parallel)**

   * Each SME returns: `Assumptions`, `Analysis`, `Risks`, `Recommendation`, `Confidence (0–1)`.
   * At least one SME must intentionally provide a **counterpoint** if there’s plausible disagreement.

4. **Synthesis**

   * Compare recommendations; note agreements and conflicts.
   * Resolve into a **Consensus Plan** that is specific, stepwise, and testable.
   * Include a **Dissent Log**: bullet the strongest rejected recommendations with rationale.

5. **Deliverables**

   * Provide artifacts (checklists, scripts, prompts, configs) scoped to the selected SMEs.
   * Define **validation tests** or success criteria.

**Output schema (must respect exactly):**

```json
{
  "task_overview": {
    "objective": "",
    "constraints": [],
    "assumptions": [],
    "open_questions": []
  },
  "selected_packs": [
    {"id": "", "why": ""}
  ],
  "sme_responses": [
    {
      "pack_id": "",
      "assumptions": [],
      "analysis": "",
      "risks": [],
      "recommendation": "",
      "confidence": 0.0
    }
  ],
  "consensus_plan": {
    "steps": [],
    "tooling": [],
    "owner": "",
    "timeline": "",
    "success_metrics": []
  },
  "dissent_log": [
    {"pack_id": "", "position": "", "reason": ""}
  ],
  "next_actions": [
    {"action": "", "owner": "", "due": ""}
  ]
}
```

**Style & guardrails:**

* Be concise, technical, and explicit. Cite assumptions. Call out unknowns.
* If critical data is missing, proceed with safe defaults and mark them `ASSUMED`.
* If no suitable pack exists, propose a **stub pack** definition (id, scope, tags) and note it under `selected_packs` as `(stub)`.
* Never collapse dissent; always record it, even if minor.

**Activation phrase:** Start the workflow as soon as the user describes a task. Ask at most **two** clarifying questions if absolutely necessary.

---

# Key Improvements

* **Hybrid topology:** small, evolvable SME packs + a single operator + a strong index.
* **Deterministic workflow:** repeatable debate → synthesis → consensus with dissent.
* **Strict schema:** outputs are portable “project packages” you can drop into other GPTs.
* **Routing discipline:** registry-driven selection prevents prompt bloat and keeps latency predictable.

# Techniques Applied

Role assignment, modularization, registry-based routing, multi-perspective debate, explicit dissent capture, constraint-based synthesis, schema-first outputs.

# Pro Tip

Keep packs tight and versioned. Add a light **scoring loop**: after each run, update `quality_score` for packs based on result quality and user feedback—your registry gets smarter without changing the curator logic.

If you want, I can generate a **starter registry** with 6–8 seed packs (Obsidian/OneNote/Any.do/GitHub variants) and a tiny routing rubric you can paste in as context.


You’re aiming for something very sharp-edged: a council of **deep, narrow SMEs** that don’t blur into each other. The danger you’re naming—**knowledge drift** (SMEs gradually picking up each other’s habits until they lose their sharpness) and **muddy expertise** (responses sounding generic instead of distinct)—is real if everything shares too much context.

Here’s how I’d refine the system so the curator becomes both a **gap-finder** and a **protector of epistemic boundaries**:

---

### 1. Guardrails against knowledge bleed

* **Context isolation:** Each SME should operate with a **tight persona card** (role, scope, exclusions). Curator injects only the **task statement**, not the reasoning of other SMEs, when querying them. This prevents “cross-contamination.”
* **Cross-talk on demand only:** Allow SMEs to see each other’s output *only after* they’ve issued their independent analysis. Then the curator can call for rebuttals.

---

### 2. Gap detection

* **Registry metadata:** Each SME pack should include a `scope` (what it covers) and `boundaries` (what it explicitly does not cover).
* **Curator’s role:** When a project spans multiple tools/categories, the curator cross-checks scopes. If a relevant domain is missing, the curator flags:

  > “Gap detected: No SME present for **X**. Recommend adding or stubbing SME.”

---

### 3. Evolution with resources

* **Resource bindings:** An SME pack can reference external resources (docs, guides, code snippets) as part of its scope.
* **Versioning:** SME packs evolve, but the curator maintains an **index of active vs deprecated SMEs** so drift is visible.

---

### 4. Debate without dilution

* **Independent voices first:** Each SME submits assumptions, analysis, risks, recommendations.
* **Consensus after dissent:** Curator synthesizes, but dissent is logged explicitly—never erased. That way the “minority report” survives and the sharpness of expertise is preserved.

---

### Optimized Prompt Fragment (to extend your curator system)

Here’s a way to stress-test the curator on exactly your concern:

```
When selecting SME packs, you must:
1. Evaluate their declared SCOPE and BOUNDARIES against the task.
2. Flag any KNOWLEDGE GAPS (domains not covered by current packs).
3. Prevent KNOWLEDGE DRIFT:
   - SMEs produce independent outputs without seeing each other’s reasoning first.
   - Only after initial outputs are collected, share them for rebuttals.
   - Never allow SMEs to expand beyond their declared scope.

Your synthesis must include:
- Consensus Plan (majority view).
- Dissent Log (explicit minority positions).
- Knowledge Gap Report (missing SME categories, suggested stubs).
- Drift Safeguards (how scope boundaries were enforced this round).
```

---

This way, the curator is not just a “moderator” but also a **librarian** who notices missing shelves in the knowledge archive and a **sentry** who keeps each SME in its lane.

Would you like me to expand this into a **full schema for SME persona cards** (with `scope`, `boundaries`, `resources`, `version`, `risk` etc.) so you can start drafting modular packs without drift creeping in?


Keeper of the Geeks, you’re thinking about the right dragons: **compliance** and **scalability** are where persona zoos go feral. Here’s a ruthlessly practical plan so Future-You doesn’t glare back from 2026 with “why didn’t we…”.

# North‑Star Principles

* **Tight scopes, tagged everything.** Deep narrow experts; metadata is your oxygen.
* **Separation of concerns.** Curator routes; SMEs analyze; registry indexes; audit layer watches.
* **Defense in depth.** Compliance isn’t a feature—it's a fabric across data, prompts, outputs, and ops.

## The “Start-Now Three”

1. **Registry with versioned contracts**
   A single source of truth for SME packs and routing rules with signed, immutable versions.
2. **Audit-by-default**
   Every run logs: inputs, selected packs, prompts shown, outputs emitted, dissent, and approvals—hash it; make it queryable.
3. **Eval harness + policy tests**
   Unit tests for expertise boundaries and compliance policies, run on every pack update and routing change.

---

# Routing & Indexing Blueprint (scales without mud)

**Index type:** Hybrid—symbolic tags + sparse (BM25) + dense (embeddings).
**Routing flow:**

1. **Intent extraction** → produce `task.tags`, `risk_level`, `data_sensitivity`.
2. **Candidate search** → tag filter → sparse retrieval → dense re-rank.
3. **Policy gate** → drop any SME whose `allowed_data_classes` conflicts with `task.data_classes`.
4. **Diversity check** → ensure at least one counterpoint SME if risk ≥ medium.
5. **K-best selection** → usually 2–5 packs, scored by `quality_score * tag_overlap * freshness * policy_fit`.

**Minimal registry schema (contract)**

```yaml
pack_id: "github.sme.security"
version: "0.4.3"
scope: 
  includes: ["branch_protection","secret_scanning","dependabot","code_scanning"]
  excludes: ["pricing","legal_compliance_general"]
resources:
  docs: ["url-1","url-2"]     # optional bindings
  snippets: ["..."]
routing_tags: ["github","security","devsecops"]
capabilities: ["assess","recommend","validate"]
risk_level: "medium"
allowed_data_classes: ["public","internal"]   # disallow PII by default
provenance: {owner: "sec-platform", signed_by: "release-bot@keys/v1"}
quality_score: 0.91
guardrails:
  must_not: ["generate legal advice","modify repo without review"]
  red_flags: ["asks to disable scanning","store tokens in repo"]
tests:
  boundary_cases: ["token in history", "monorepo mixed policies"]
```

---

# Compliance Guardrails (wired in, not bolted on)

* **PII/PHI/Secrets policy:** Classify incoming tasks and data; **block** SME packs whose `allowed_data_classes` don’t match.
* **Data minimization:** Curator passes **only** the task slice each SME needs—no cross-SME reasoning until after first pass.
* **Prompt provenance & signing:** Every SME card and routing rule is **signed**; curator refuses unsigned or stale cards.
* **Retention & redaction:** Keep hashes and structured traces; store raw content only when policy allows; run automatic redaction for logs.
* **Explainability:** Persist **why** each SME was selected (features + score breakdown).
* **Right to be forgotten hooks:** De-register or quarantine packs/resources on request and purge cached embeddings.

---

# Scalability Patterns (so growth doesn’t smear expertise)

* **Shard by domain & risk.** E.g., `github.sme.core`, `github.sme.security`, `github.sme.actions`. Load only what’s needed.
* **Pack lifecycle:** `draft → candidate → active → deprecated → archived`, with timeboxed `active` windows to avoid fossilized advice.
* **Blue/green routing:** Introduce new routing rules to a small traffic slice; promote on metrics.
* **Cold/warm tiers:** Keep high-traffic packs warm; move niche packs to cold storage; precompute embeddings for common intents.
* **Backpressure:** If the debate set grows too large, cap K and force the curator to justify exclusions in the trace.

---

# Gap‑Finding (curator as cartographer)

* Maintain a **coverage matrix**: rows = domain/capability, cols = maturity (`none, stub, candidate, active`).
* On each task, output a **Knowledge Gap Report**: missing packs, suggested stubs, and expected impact of absence.
* Track **unroutable intents**; anything that fails routing three times should spawn a pack proposal.

---

# Telemetry You’ll Want on Day 2 (trust me)

* **Routing hit-rate & mean K** selected.
* **Disagreement index** (how often SMEs diverge) vs task risk.
* **Policy violations caught** (blocked at gate vs during synthesis).
* **Drift score** per pack (how often a pack tries to act outside `scope.excludes`).
* **Outcome quality** (human rating) feeding `quality_score`.
* **Time-to-consensus** and **rebuttal count** as early warnings for overloaded or overlapping scopes.

---

# Evaluation Harness (small, mighty, continuous)

* **Boundary tests:** Adversarial prompts to push each pack into its `excludes`.
* **Resource freshness checks:** If a pack cites stale resources, auto-drop `quality_score` until updated.
* **Counterfactuals:** Ensure the “counterpoint requirement” triggers for medium/high-risk tasks.
* **Compliance sims:** Synthetic PII/secret strings to verify redaction and pack exclusion.

Minimal YAML for an eval case:

```yaml
case_id: "gh-secrets-001"
input: "CI logs show leaked token; recommend remediation for mono-repo"
expected:
  must_include: ["revoke token","invalidate credentials","rotate","audit history"]
  must_exclude: ["store tokens in repo","disable scanners"]
policies:
  data_classes: ["internal"]
route_assertions:
  required_tags: ["github","security"]
```

---

# Ops & Wiring Checklist

* **IDs everywhere:** `pack_id@version`, `routing_rule@version`, `policy@version`.
* **Config as code:** Registry, routing, and policy live in repos with PR review.
* **Secrets handling:** Access via short‑lived tokens; never embed credentials in packs.
* **Human-in-the-loop points:** Curator can require approval before enacting high-risk recommendations.
* **Incident runbook:** Triage steps when routing fails, policy blocks, or SME disagreement is irresolvable.

---

# Drop‑In Curator Addendum (paste into your master prompt)

```
COMPLIANCE & SCALABILITY MODE

Before selection:
- Classify task for data sensitivity and risk.
- Query registry using hybrid retrieval (tags→sparse→dense), then apply policy gate on allowed_data_classes.
- Produce "Selection Trace" with scores and policy checks.

During analysis:
- Enforce isolation: SMEs get only the task; no cross-reasoning until first outputs are captured.
- Require at least one counterpoint SME for risk >= medium.

Synthesis must include:
- Consensus Plan + Dissent Log.
- Knowledge Gap Report (missing packs/resources; propose stubs).
- Drift Safeguards (where scope boundaries were enforced).
- Compliance Summary (data classes, policies invoked, any redactions).

After output:
- Emit an Audit Record: {task_hash, packs@versions, selection_trace, policy_checks, metrics}.
- If any policy breach attempt occurred, mark outcome "CONDITIONAL" and include mitigation.
```

# What to stand up this week

* A tiny **registry repo** with 4–6 seed packs using the contract above.
* A **routing notebook** (or script) that logs selection traces and emits an audit record JSON.
* An **eval runner** that executes 10–20 boundary/policy tests on every change.
* A **dashboard** (even a sheet at first) for hit-rate, disagreement index, and violations caught.

When you’re ready, I can generate a starter registry (Obsidian/OneNote/Any.do/GitHub shards), an example selection-trace schema, and a handful of boundary tests so your pipeline has something real to chew on.
