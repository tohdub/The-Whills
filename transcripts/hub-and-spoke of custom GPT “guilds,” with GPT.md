Not crazy—more like a tidy galaxy with a sensible physics. A hub-and-spoke of custom GPT “guilds,” with **GPT | Master (The Trinity)** as the **source of truth** and **The Whills** as the meta-governor, can absolutely work. The trick is to nail the contracts: who owns what, how knowledge flows, and how new guilds get spawned without mutating canon.

Here’s a pragmatic blueprint you can use right now.

# Structure at a glance

- **Hub (The Trinity / GPT | Master):** canonical source of truth (SoT), schema owner, starter-pack generator, signer of releases.
    
- **Meta-Hub (The Whills):** governance, federation control plane, orchestration of guild lifecycles, metrics & audits, cross-guild synthesis.
    
- **Spokes (Guild GPTs):** independent SMEs operating on local problems, producing reports/artifacts to feed back upstream.
    

# Operating model (who does what)

- **Trinity (Present/Past/Future):**
    
    - Architect → publishes contracts/schemas, validates routing maps, enforces interface stability.
        
    - Archivist → versioned knowledge store, immutable transcripts, provenance tags.
        
    - Auteur → proposes new starter packs, patterns, refactors; incubates “next guilds.”
        
- **Whills (Meta):**
    
    - Registry of guilds, capabilities, and data scopes.
        
    - Policy engine (who can read/write which strata of knowledge).
        
    - Evaluations & drift detection across the whole constellation.
        
    - Auto-scaler for new guilds (mint → pilot → graduate → sunset).
        

# Minimal interfaces to make it real

Think of these as “API contracts” for minds.

**1) Starter Pack Contract (from Trinity to Guild)**

- `persona.json` (role, methods, constraints)
    
- `routing_map.json` (inputs, allowed tools, escalation paths)
    
- `knowledge_seed.md` (curated, citation-anchored)
    
- `eval_suite/` (golden tasks + expected behaviors)
    
- `report_templates/` (how the guild talks back)
    

**2) Reporting Contract (from Guild to Whills/Trinity)**  
A simple evented envelope—machine-readable, diff-friendly:

```json
{
  "guild_id": "software_department",
  "run_id": "2025-08-17T14:31:24Z-9bf2",
  "inputs_summary": "Top 10 incidents by MTTR in the last 7 days",
  "methods_used": ["kb.lookup", "ticket.parse", "pattern.mine"],
  "findings": [
    {"id": "F-001", "claim": "Driver v4.2.1 increases boot time by 18-22%", "evidence": ["ticket#78422","benchmark#B-119"], "confidence": 0.78}
  ],
  "proposals": [
    {"id": "P-003", "change": "Pin driver v4.1.9 for SKUs A/C", "impact": "MTTR -30%", "risk": "medium"}
  ],
  "artifacts": ["report://software_dept/weekly_2025-08-17.md"],
  "provenance": {"model": "gpt-5-thinking", "kb_snapshot": "v2025.08.15", "tool_versions": {"parser":"1.3.2"}},
  "guardrails": {"pii_check":"pass", "policy_deviation": []}
}
```

**3) Knowledge Merge Protocol (into Archivist)**

- Only **reports with evidence & provenance** may be merged.
    
- Merges happen via PR-like reviews with automated checks:
    
    - schema validation,
        
    - citation resolvability,
        
    - eval regression (did this change break a golden test?),
        
    - conflict scanner (claim collisions with existing canon).
        

# Data flow (text map)

1. **Trinity** emits `starter_pack@vX.Y` → **Guild** spins up.
    
2. **Guild** operates locally, writes **Reports** + **Artifacts**.
    
3. **Whills** ingests reports, scores them, routes high-value deltas to **Archivist**.
    
4. **Archivist** merges into canonical knowledge with version bump; **Architect** republishes interfaces if needed; **Auteur** proposes next improvements.
    
5. **Whills** may mint new guilds (or split/merge existing ones) based on gaps identified.
    

# Governance & safety rails

- **Single Source of Truth:** Only the Archivist’s corpus is canonical; guilds hold _working sets_ that reset against SoT snapshots.
    
- **Schema-first:** All personas, routes, and reports validate against centrally versioned JSON Schemas (`/contracts/*`).
    
- **Provenance required:** No merge without machine-checkable sources. Confidence must be explicit.
    
- **Change control:** Canon changes happen in signed releases (`SoT vYYYY.MM.DD+build`), with changelogs and rollback points.
    
- **Policy lenses:** The Whills enforces PII, licensing, and domain boundaries before merge or spawn.
    

# Scaling pattern (how Whills “creates other GPTs” sanely)

- **Mint:** Clone a proven starter pack; set scope & KPIs.
    
- **Pilot:** Run behind a shadow switch; compare to baseline via eval suite.
    
- **Graduate:** Promote after meeting quality gates; register in Whills.
    
- **Evolve:** Periodic retraining/retuning gated by eval deltas.
    
- **Sunset:** Archive guilds whose scope collapses or is superseded.
    

# Telemetry that actually matters

- **Truth pressure:** contradiction rate vs. SoT, unresolved claim collisions.
    
- **Usefulness:** task success %, MTTR on incident classes, human-time saved.
    
- **Reliability:** tool error rates, escalation correctness, route adherence.
    
- **Drift:** embedding-space drift of facts, schema non-compliance frequency.

```

# How your Tech Support Hub pack fits today

- Your ZIP already contains **personas** and **routing maps**—great foundations for `/starters/tech_support_hub`.
    
- Add the **report envelope** above and a small **eval_suite/** for each persona (e.g., known troubleshooting tasks with expected steps).
    
- Register each guild in `/registry/guilds.yaml` with scope, owner, KPIs, and current SoT snapshot hash.
    

# Failure modes to guard against (and quick fixes)

- **Canon drift:** guild claims contradict SoT → fix with mandatory SoT snapshot pinning per run + contradiction alarms.
    
- **Schema creep:** personas/routes diverge → fix with CI schema checks on every starter/route/report.
    
- **Over-centralization:** hub becomes bottleneck → delegate pre-merge scoring to Whills, but keep Archivist as final signer.
    
- **Guild sprawl:** too many micro-guilds → Whills periodically merges low-signal guilds; enforce a minimum KPI bar.
    

# A tiny example to operationalize now

- Wrap your current `routing_map_*.json` in the schema guardrail.
    
- Add `report_templates/weekly_findings.md` that populates the JSON envelope fields (so humans and machines agree).
    
- Stand up an **eval harness**: 10 golden incidents with known fixes; guilds must hit ≥90% before reports are considered for merge.
    
- Publish **SoT v2025.08.17**; pin the Tech Support guilds to that snapshot; run a pilot and inspect the first merged report.
    

This hub-and-spoke federation is perfectly sane—_if_ you treat ideas like software: typed interfaces, versioned knowledge, automated checks, and clear hand-offs. The fun part is watching The Whills behave like a benevolent librarian-orchestrator: spawning new guilds where the map is fuzzy, retiring them where the terrain is paved.

Next logical step: I can turn your current ZIP into a compliant **starter pack scaffold** (contracts, report templates, eval stubs) so the first guild can run and report into The Whills cleanly.
