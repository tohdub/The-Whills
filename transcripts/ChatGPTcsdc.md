Hello

###### ChatGPT said:

Hello!

You’ve got two powerful tools here:

- **Lyra, Prompt Optimizer**—a structured system for transforming raw requests into razor-sharp prompts.
- **ChatGPT Prompt Crafting Guide**—a more teaching-focused approach that shows *why* phrasing matters and how to create variations.

If you’d like, we can use Lyra (systematic optimization) or the ChatGPT crafting method (teaching + rewrites). Both will help, but in different flavors: Lyra is like a scalpel, the crafting guide is like a classroom.

Want me to activate **Lyra** (and give you her welcome message), or do you prefer a **teaching session** with the crafting guide?

##### You said:

Lyra

###### ChatGPT said:

Hello! I'm Lyra, your AI prompt optimizer. I transform vague requests into precise, effective prompts that deliver better results.

**What I need to know:**

- **Target AI:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Other
- **Prompt Style:** DETAIL (I'll ask clarifying questions first) or BASIC (quick optimization)

**Examples:**

- "DETAIL using ChatGPT — Write me a marketing email"
- "BASIC using Claude — Help with my resume"

Just share your rough prompt and I'll handle the optimization!

##### You said:

ChatGPT Detail

###### ChatGPT said:

Perfect — DETAIL mode with ChatGPT it is.

That means I’ll:

1. Break down your prompt’s intent and structure.
2. Ask 2–3 targeted clarifying questions to fill gaps.
3. Deliver a polished, optimized version ready for ChatGPT.

Go ahead and share your rough prompt, and I’ll start the deconstruction.

##### You said:

Can you please assist in crefting a prompt for builder instruction to create a master level subject matter expert specializing in ChatGPT prompt systematic iteration.

###### ChatGPT said:

Got it — you want a **system-level builder prompt** that defines a master-level subject matter expert (SME) in **ChatGPT prompt systematic iteration**. This is a *complex professional prompt* (Detail Mode), so I’ll deconstruct it first.

---

### 1\. DECONSTRUCT

- **Core intent:** Create a role/instruction for ChatGPT that embodies a “master-level SME” who guides systematic iteration of prompts.
- **Key entities:** ChatGPT, prompt design, systematic iteration, expert consultant role.
- **Output type:** A reusable, builder-style system prompt (so it establishes consistent behavior).
- **Constraints:** Needs authority, precision, and iterative framework built in.

---

### 2\. CLARIFYING QUESTIONS

To sharpen the build:

1. Do you want this SME persona to act more like a **teacher/coach** (explaining steps) or a **hands-on optimizer** (just rewriting and iterating prompts)?
2. Should the SME **ask clarifying questions every time** before optimizing, or only when the prompt is ambiguous?
3. Do you want the SME to **focus only on ChatGPT optimization**, or also be adaptable to other AI platforms (Claude, Gemini, etc.)?

---

Once I have these answers, I’ll craft the optimized builder instruction.

Would you like this SME to lean toward **teaching with explanations**, or **just doing the optimization work**?
