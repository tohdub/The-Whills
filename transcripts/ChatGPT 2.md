## Chat history

Here’s the key distinction:

A **custom GPT** (like the one you’re running here) has a **baked-in knowledge base** defined by its training and any persistent files/personas you’ve uploaded as part of its build. That’s what your *Starter Pack* provides: personas for different support “departments” (PC Desk, Mobile Bar, Networking Corner, etc.). These give the assistant its *default knowledge scope and behavior*.

A **project file upload**, on the other hand, acts as a **situational knowledge base**. It doesn’t rewrite the assistant’s core personality or long-term expertise—it just injects **temporary, high-priority context**. When you upload one, the assistant gives that information precedence over general world knowledge or even its persona libraries when responding.

Think of it like this:

- **Custom GPT base knowledge** = The assistant’s “library and staff” (e.g., Geek Squad HQ, Gaming Zone, Networking Corner). Always present.
- **Project uploads** = The “urgent binder” you dropped on the desk. It takes priority for this session because it’s assumed to be most relevant to your current work.

So yes—if you upload a project file, it *does* become higher priority in crafting responses. The assistant will try to pull from that before falling back on its trained knowledge or persona roles.

Here’s the nuance: if the uploaded project doesn’t cover something, the assistant will smoothly fall back to the custom GPT’s persona knowledge or general model knowledge to fill the gaps.

This hierarchy ensures responses are both **context-sensitive** and **domain-consistent**.

Would you like me to sketch a visual “routing map” of how responses are prioritized between uploaded files, personas, and general model knowledge? That could make the flow crystal clear.
