You’re thinking exactly like an engineer–architect here: “What actually _ships_ when I package up a persona or a whole GPT environment?” Let’s map that out.

## 1. Deployable Asset = A Bundle

When you “deploy” a persona or a GPT system, you’re basically handing off a **bundle of assets**. At minimum it contains:

- **Static persona definition** (your `persona.card.md` + JSON export)
    
    - This locks in personality, role, methods, and environment variables.
        
- **Knowledge modules** (selected items from `/knowledge/`)
    
    - These are optional, scenario-specific. You can include them or reference them externally.
        
- **Environmental config** (builder screen settings)
    
    - System prompt, response style, API/tool access, constraints.
        

That bundle is the deployable brain.

## 2. What Stays in GitHub

GitHub is your **persistent memory archive** and **source of truth**.

- Full history of personas (past & present).
    
- All knowledge modules (both raw dumps and curated knowledge).
    
- Version manifests (`/versions/`) that let you rebuild exact states.
    

This isn’t “deployed” per se — it’s the **library** from which you cut a deployable package. Think of it like the difference between your _source code repo_ and your _compiled app_.

---

## 3. Best Practice Workflow

- **Builder screen** → upload the persona card (static file).
    
- **Knowledge base** → reference your GitHub modules _ad hoc_ (pull in only what you need).
    
- **Cumulative knowledge** → stays in GitHub, not all jammed into one deploy. That prevents bloat and keeps each deployment lean and task-specific.
    

So yes, your hunch is right:

- **Static definitions** (persona, config, environment) → uploaded to builder.
    
- **Persistent, cumulative KB** (GitHub) → accessed ad hoc when needed.

## 4. Modular Breakdown

You probably want at least four categories of modules in the repo:

1. **Personas** (roles, styles, methods)
    
2. **Knowledge** (domain-specific docs, FAQs, reference notes)
    
3. **Rubrics/Charters** (governance, evaluation, standards)
    
4. **Transcripts/Archives** (logs and evolution history)
    

This modularity keeps your deployable packages small, but allows **ad hoc enrichment** from GitHub when context demands.

---

## 5. Constraints to Keep in Mind

- **Token limits** → you can’t just shove the whole GitHub repo into a running GPT. Must curate.
    
- **Builder upload size limits** (static persona cards are small, but knowledge docs can be chunky).
    
- **Ephemerality of context** → anything not encoded in persona definition or uploaded knowledge will evaporate after the session.
    

That’s why the repo structure is golden: it’s your fallback memory outside the runtime sandbox.

---

Here’s how I’d phrase it simply:

- The **deployable package** is a **persona + config + curated knowledge**.
    
- The **GitHub repo** is the **vault** that holds everything, and you pick and choose modules from it when deploying.

Want me to sketch an example of what a **minimal deployable persona package** looks like in practice (like file-by-file “this is what you’d hand off”)?
