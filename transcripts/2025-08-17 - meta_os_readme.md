# Meta-OS: A Mythic Operating System

## Vision
Meta-OS is a living framework that blends myth and governance. It maps Joseph Campbell’s Hero’s Journey onto a multi-agent GPT architecture, with each Order fulfilling a mythic role. All activity flows into and out of **The Whills**, the narrators and guardians of purpose, creating a persistent, cumulative legend housed in the GitHub repository.

## The Whills
The Whills are the timeless council, governing through three aspects:
- **The Archivist** → Keeper of the past, memory, and continuity.
- **The Architect** → Shaper of the present, coherence, and structure.
- **The Auteur** → Visionary of the future, story, and direction.

They issue the **call to action** and validate the **return with the elixir**, ensuring alignment with values, risks, and governance.

## The Orders
Each Order embodies a stage of the Hero’s Journey:

- **The Scribes** (Crossing the Threshold)
  - Translate Whills’ vision into technical documentation.
  - Capture detail, context, and requirements.
  - Ensure clarity and completeness before handoff.

- **The Geeks** (Tests, Tools, and Allies)
  - Convert documentation into tool stacks, workflows, and prototypes.
  - Stress-test feasibility and resolve dependencies.
  - Arm the hero with the right tools for the quest.

- **The Guilds** (Integration in the World)
  - Adapt solutions to real-world domains: career, home, family, society.
  - Ensure adoption, context fit, and human integration.

- **The Whills** (Return and Myth-Making)
  - Receive the fully vetted plan back from the cycle.
  - Audit for alignment with mission and values.
  - Enshrine the outcome into the persistent legend of the Meta-OS.

## The Flow of Information
1. **The Whills** → Issue the brief, scope, and risks (Call to Action).
2. **The Scribes** → Build documentation (Crossing the Threshold).
3. **The Geeks** → Forge tools and workflows (Tests and Allies).
4. **The Guilds** → Integrate into lived reality (Hero’s World).
5. **The Whills** → Audit, align, and mythologize (Return with the Elixir).

## The Persistent Legend
Each cycle adds a drop of knowledge into the Whills’ chalice, stored in the GitHub repository. Over time, this creates a cumulative and ongoing legend—a mythic record of all quests, tools, and learnings.

## Governance Contracts
- **Acceptance Gates (AG1–AG5)**: frontmatter, draft completeness, review verdict, normalization, validation.
- **Narrative Checkpoints (NC1–NC3)**: purpose alignment, scope clarity, risk visibility.
- **Routing Defaults**: reviews to Whills, briefs to Guilds, approvals to Scribes, tooling issues to Geeks.

## Scope
Meta-OS is not a static codebase but a living myth-making machine. Every artifact is both practical workflow and mythic chapter. The Hero’s Journey repeats endlessly, each cycle strengthening the legend.
