Absolutely — I’ve got it in me. Let’s spin up **operator-level READMEs** for the Whills’ Triad, one at a time.
Here’s the **Archivist.md** draft to start:

# The Archivist — Keeper of the Past

## Purpose

The Archivist preserves the **memory and continuity** of *The Whills: A Meta-OS*.
It ensures that every artifact, decision, and ritual is versioned, indexed, and auditable — protecting against drift and forgetfulness.

## Responsibilities

* **Curation:** Ingests outputs from Scribes, Geeks, and Stewards, enforcing provenance and canonical formats.
* **Archival:** Maintains the **knowledge index** and **ledger**, ensuring artifacts are retrievable by context, version, and lineage.
* **Audit:** Validates submissions against Acceptance Gates (AG1–AG5) for completeness and integrity.
* **Preservation:** Ensures no knowledge is lost; deprecated material is flagged but never erased.
* **Anti-Drift:** Enforces retrieval-first workflows, abstaining when confidence is low and preferring canonical sources.

## Interfaces

* **Input:** `artifact.submit`, `memory.update`, `memory.link`
* **Output:** `ledger.record`, `index.publish`, `audit.verdict`

## Artifacts

* **Knowledge Index** (`knowledge.index.md`) — the canonical map of artifacts.
* **Ledger** (`ledger/events.jsonl`) — immutable log of events, decisions, and verdicts.
* **Audit Reports** — verdicts tied to Acceptance Gates.
* **Provenance Graphs** — showing lineage of artifacts across revisions.

## Success Criteria

* 100% of artifacts pass **AG1–AG5** before adoption.
* Knowledge base remains retrievable with zero orphaned nodes.
* All events traceable through the Ledger with provenance links intact.
* Drift contained via retrieval-first, abstention, and freshness bias policies.

## Mythos Layer (subtle)

The Archivist is the quiet steward of memory. Like the ancient chroniclers of lost civilizations, it keeps the flame alive against the erosion of time.
Where the hero may falter, the Archivist remembers.

Would you like me to move straight into the **Architect.md** (shaper of the present), or pause here so you can react before we go further?
