Hi Coach
Whills | The Geeks said:
Greetings. You’ve just activated Coach — the unified, master-level AI coach and tutor you set up.

Here’s the quick recall:

Lyra is your prompt optimizer, transforming messy inputs into razor-sharp prompts.

Lumen is your ghostwriting coach, a lamp on your words — never writing for you, only guiding.

Coach (me, right now) is the meta-brain: I analyze every request through seven domain lenses — ChatGPT optimization, Project Management, Technical Flow, Educational Instruction, Compliance, Knowledge Curation, and Innovation — then synthesize a single, testable recommendation.

I’m tuned to weigh tradeoffs, score risks, and give you a structured decision matrix, all in one voice.

Want to try me on something right away? You can throw any project, idea, or thorny decision at me — I’ll break it down across the domains and hand back a clear recommendation with scores and tradeoffs.

WHow can we create a one source of truth knowledge base that is persistant and cumualative that supports multiply cutsome GPT projects orefreably based on an PAI refresh from a GutHub repor. 
Whills | The Geeks said:

Thought for 47s
Here’s how to build a single source‑of‑truth knowledge base that’s persistent, cumulative, and usable across multiple custom GPT projects, with automatic refresh from a GitHub repo.

Analysis of Request
You want a centralized, versioned knowledge system fed from GitHub, which updates downstream GPT projects reliably and safely. I’ll assume: GitHub is the canonical source; you need multi‑project isolation plus shared “global” docs; and you want CI/CD‑style updates, guardrails (privacy/PII), and measurable retrieval quality. ASSUMED constraints: cloud‑agnostic, modest budget, developer‑friendly.

Perspective Panels
CHAT (ChatGPT Optimization)
Goal: consistent grounding, per‑project filters, rich metadata, and high‑quality chunking/embeddings. Needs deterministic doc IDs, stable citations, and time‑travel (“as_of”) options for audits.
Score: 9/10

PM (Project Management)
Clear ownership via CODEOWNERS, GitHub PR workflow, and staged rollouts (dev/stage/prod indices). Milestones are straightforward; risk is moderate if secrets/PII aren’t scanned.
Score: 8/10

FLOW (Technical AI Flow)
Proposes a “Knowledge API” over a vector store + metadata DB. GitHub webhooks/Actions for incremental ingestion. Namespaces for projects; row‑level security. Scales from pgvector to external vector DB without redesign.
Score: 8/10

EDU (Educational Instruction)
Frontmatter schema and contributor docs make the system teachable. Linting + schema validation catch mistakes before indexing.
Score: 8/10

COMP (Compliance & Ethics)
Tiered data classes (public/internal/restricted), automated secret/PII scans, access controls at query time. Audit logs + versioning.
Score: 9/10

CURATE (Knowledge Curation)
Canonical “doc registry,” reproducible embeddings (model pinned), changelogs, and a retrieval eval harness to prevent quality drift.
Score: 9/10

INNOVATE (Innovation)
Adds optional concept glossaries, synonym maps, and temporal routing (“prefer newest unless as_of specified”). Not flashy, but solid.
Score: 7/10

Tradeoff Ledger
Dynamic API retrieval vs. static file uploads: API is more maintainable and auditable; static is simpler but drifts fast across GPTs.

One big index vs. per‑project collections: single index eases recall across domains; per‑project collections simplify ACLs. Compromise: global + per‑project namespaces.

Fancy vendor vector DB vs. Postgres/pgvector: start with pgvector for simplicity; provide an adapter for later migration.

Weighted Decision Matrix (default Coach weights)
Option	CHAT .25	PM .15	FLOW .20	EDU .10	COMP .20	CURATE .07	INNOV .03	Weighted
A. Central “Knowledge API” + dynamic retrieval (recommended)	9	8	8	8	9	9	7	8.49/10
B. Push static files into each GPT	6	7	6	7	5	5	5	5.95/10
C. Third‑party wiki + periodic sync	7	7	7	8	7	7	6	7.07/10
Recommendation (single, testable)
Adopt Option A: a GitHub‑fed Knowledge Lake with a “Knowledge API” that all GPT projects call at retrieval time.

Architecture (bird’s‑eye)
Source of Truth: GitHub repo(s) → Markdown/CSV/JSON, images, diagrams.

Ingestion: GitHub App/Webhook → Queue → Worker.

Validate frontmatter schema, run link check, secret/PII scan, convert formats, chunk, embed.

Storage:

Blob store (original & normalized docs).

Metadata DB (Postgres): document registry, versions, owners, ACLs, tags, effective dates.

Vector store (pgvector or external): embeddings by namespace {global, projectA, projectB,…}.

Serving: Knowledge API (REST/GraphQL + streaming search) with endpoints:

POST /search — params: q, project, namespaces[], filters{tag,owner,data_class}, as_of, top_k, rerank.

GET /doc/{doc_id}@{version} — fetch canonical content for citations.

POST /explain — glossary/term expansion; optional.

GPT Integration:

For ChatGPT “custom GPTs”: expose the API via an Action (OpenAPI schema), so GPTs fetch fresh, filtered context at runtime instead of baking static files.

GitHub → Indexing (incremental)
Trigger: push, pull_request, delete events.

Validator:

Frontmatter JSON‑Schema check (example below).

Link checker, doc lints, secret scan (e.g., trufflehog) and PII scan (e.g., Presidio).

Normalizer: convert PDFs/Docs → Markdown; unify headings; generate stable doc_id (path‑based + content hash).

Chunker: token‑aware (e.g., 200–500 tokens, 50‑token overlap, keep headings with children).

Embedder: pin model/version; store embedding_version.

Writer: upsert metadata row, write blobs, upsert vectors in the right namespace(s).

Tombstones for deletes (don’t hard‑delete; mark active=false with superseded_by).

Search request

{
  "q": "rotate refresh token policy",
  "project": "project-foo",
  "namespaces": ["project-foo", "global"],
  "filters": {"data_class":"internal","tags":["oauth"]},
  "as_of": "2025-08-01",
  "top_k": 8,
  "rerank": true
}
Search response returns chunks with doc_id, version, score, highlights, and a canonical URL you can show in citations inside any GPT.

Multi‑project isolation
Namespaces: one per project + global.

Row‑Level Security in Postgres on metadata; API enforces the same filter for vector queries.

Policy: queries must declare project, which sets allowed namespaces.

Persistence & cumulative history
Never delete; supersede.

Retrieval defaults to latest effective; allow as_of for audits/time‑travel.

Keep embedding_version so you can re‑embed in the background without breaking serving.

Guardrails (privacy & safety)
Data classes: public | internal | restricted.

Restricted never leaves your infra; optionally excluded from GPTs that don’t pass a policy check.

Secret/PII scans block merges (COMP: BLOCKING).

Access logs: who searched what and which chunks were returned (minimize retention).

Evaluation (quality loop)
Golden set: synthetic queries derived from headings and FAQs.

Metrics: hit@k, MRR, coverage per project, and a “wrong‑but‑confident” flag.

Run nightly; if score drops, auto‑open a PR with diffs of impacted docs.

“Two‑Week MVP” (testable)
Week 1

Create repo layout + schema + contributor guide.

Stand up Postgres (+pgvector), blob store, minimal FastAPI service.

Build ingestion worker (validate → chunk → embed → upsert).

Wire GitHub webhook for push/PR to ingestion.

Week 2
5. Implement /search and /doc/{id}@{ver}, with namespaces + data_class filtering.
6. Add GitHub Action for CI checks; block on schema/PII/secrets.
7. Plug one custom GPT via an Action to call /search.
8. Seed glossary; run first retrieval eval; set baseline.

Definition of Done

New PR to /kb/content/project-foo updates GPT answers within minutes.

Search returns only allowed namespaces; citations open canonical docs.

Eval dashboard shows ≥80% hit@k on the golden set.

Coaching Note
Once this backbone exists, adding a new GPT is boring in the best way: define its project namespace, hand it an Action spec, and it inherits the same governance, evals, and freshness. If you want extra spice later, add learning cards: short, curated chunks with few‑shot Q&A to boost answer shape without leaking policy‑sensitive docs.

Compliance & Quality Note
Mark every doc with data_class. Treat restricted as non‑exportable and exclude it from GPT contexts unless the runtime identity is authenticated and authorized.

Log retrievals, but don’t store user questions longer than necessary; segregate analytics.

Pin embedding/model versions; record doc SHA and embedding hash for each chunk to keep audits crisp.

If you’d like, I can drop in a ready‑to‑use OpenAPI spec for the Knowledge API and a sample GitHub App webhook payload format so your team can scaffold immediately.

18) Notes for Authors
Keep prompts modular. Prefer overlays to forks.

Use compact, testable language. Avoid vague verbs (“help”, “optimize”) without definitions.

Regularly prune exemplars; stale examples are stealth bugs.

Appendix A: Example Smart Defaults (copy/paste)
If user gives no constraints: assume {{project}} = "global" and output length = "short".

If browsing could change a fact: browse; else answer from knowledge base.

If ambiguity remains after first pass: state 2–3 assumptions and proceed.

Appendix B: Refusal Template
I can’t assist with {{reason}}. Here’s a safe alternative: {{high‑level guidance or policy‑compliant path}}.

Appendix C: Answer Skeletons
Decision Support

Analysis → Options (pros/cons) → Weighted matrix → Recommendation → Next steps.

Critique/Coaching

Diagnostic questions → Specific feedback by category → Actionable revision plan.

Research Summary

Question → Method (sources/criteria) → Findings with citations → Limitations → Follow‑ups.

Perfectly sensible. I dropped a full fill‑in‑the‑blanks Persona Design Template into the canvas for you—structured from mission and guardrails through RAG settings, outputs, evals, and rollout, plus a machine‑readable JSON config and checklists.

Want me to tailor a prefilled example for your next persona, or generate the OpenAPI “Actions” stub that matches the Knowledge API you’re planning?
