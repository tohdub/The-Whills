# Guilds Order — README

## Purpose

The Guilds exist to **integrate solutions into lived reality** — career, home, family, society. They ensure adoption, context fit, and human integration, closing the loop of the Hero’s Journey.

## Form

* **Guild Hall (coordination):**

  * Guildmaster (operations)
  * Memory Steward (persistent knowledge)
  * QA Foreman (acceptance gates)
  * Adoption Lead (behavior & training)
* **Practice Guilds (domain expertise):** Career, Household, Health, Finance, Civic — each led by a Guild Chair with Masters → Journeymen → Apprentices.
* **Clinics (cross-cutting):** Onboarding, Tooling Adapters, Measurement, Safety & Ethics.

## Function

1. **Intake:** Briefs arrive from Scribes (AG1 complete).
2. **Triage:** Routed to appropriate Practice Guild.
3. **Production:** Integration Plan, Playbook, and Adapters created.
4. **Acceptance:** QA Foreman validates AG2–AG5 and NC1–NC3.
5. **Integration:** Pilots in real contexts with adoption supports.
6. **Memory:** Memory Steward updates persistent legend with Adoption Report and Memory Record.
