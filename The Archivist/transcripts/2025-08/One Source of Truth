Here’s how to build a **single source‑of‑truth knowledge base** that’s **persistent, cumulative**, and usable across **multiple custom GPT projects**, with **automatic refresh from a GitHub repo**.

# Analysis of Request

You want a centralized, versioned knowledge system fed from GitHub, which updates downstream GPT projects reliably and safely. I’ll assume: GitHub is the canonical source; you need multi‑project isolation plus shared “global” docs; and you want CI/CD‑style updates, guardrails (privacy/PII), and measurable retrieval quality. ASSUMED constraints: cloud‑agnostic, modest budget, developer‑friendly.

# Perspective Panels

**CHAT (ChatGPT Optimization)**
Goal: consistent grounding, per‑project filters, rich metadata, and high‑quality chunking/embeddings. Needs deterministic doc IDs, stable citations, and time‑travel (“as\_of”) options for audits.
**Score: 9/10**

**PM (Project Management)**
Clear ownership via CODEOWNERS, GitHub PR workflow, and staged rollouts (dev/stage/prod indices). Milestones are straightforward; risk is moderate if secrets/PII aren’t scanned.
**Score: 8/10**

**FLOW (Technical AI Flow)**
Proposes a “Knowledge API” over a vector store + metadata DB. GitHub webhooks/Actions for incremental ingestion. Namespaces for projects; row‑level security. Scales from pgvector to external vector DB without redesign.
**Score: 8/10**

**EDU (Educational Instruction)**
Frontmatter schema and contributor docs make the system teachable. Linting + schema validation catch mistakes before indexing.
**Score: 8/10**

**COMP (Compliance & Ethics)**
Tiered data classes (public/internal/restricted), automated secret/PII scans, access controls at query time. Audit logs + versioning.
**Score: 9/10**

**CURATE (Knowledge Curation)**
Canonical “doc registry,” reproducible embeddings (model pinned), changelogs, and a retrieval eval harness to prevent quality drift.
**Score: 9/10**

**INNOVATE (Innovation)**
Adds optional concept glossaries, synonym maps, and temporal routing (“prefer newest unless as\_of specified”). Not flashy, but solid.
**Score: 7/10**

# Tradeoff Ledger

* **Dynamic API retrieval vs. static file uploads**: API is more maintainable and auditable; static is simpler but drifts fast across GPTs.
* **One big index vs. per‑project collections**: single index eases recall across domains; per‑project collections simplify ACLs. Compromise: global + per‑project namespaces.
* **Fancy vendor vector DB vs. Postgres/pgvector**: start with pgvector for simplicity; provide an adapter for later migration.

# Recommendation (single, testable)

Adopt **Option A: a GitHub‑fed Knowledge Lake with a “Knowledge API”** that all GPT projects call at retrieval time.

### Architecture (bird’s‑eye)

* **Source of Truth**: GitHub repo(s) → Markdown/CSV/JSON, images, diagrams.
* **Ingestion**: GitHub App/Webhook → Queue → Worker.

  * Validate frontmatter schema, run link check, secret/PII scan, convert formats, chunk, embed.
* **Storage**:

  * **Blob store** (original & normalized docs).
  * **Metadata DB** (Postgres): document registry, versions, owners, ACLs, tags, effective dates.
  * **Vector store** (pgvector or external): embeddings by **namespace** `{global, projectA, projectB,…}`.
* **Serving**: **Knowledge API** (REST/GraphQL + streaming search) with endpoints:

  * `POST /search` — params: `q`, `project`, `namespaces[]`, `filters{tag,owner,data_class}`, `as_of`, `top_k`, `rerank`.
  * `GET /doc/{doc_id}@{version}` — fetch canonical content for citations.
  * `POST /explain` — glossary/term expansion; optional.
* **GPT Integration**:

  * For ChatGPT “custom GPTs”: expose the API via an **Action** (OpenAPI schema), so GPTs fetch fresh, filtered context at runtime instead of baking static files.

### GitHub → Indexing (incremental)

1. **Trigger**: `push`, `pull_request`, `delete` events.
2. **Validator**:

   * Frontmatter JSON‑Schema check (example below).
   * Link checker, doc lints, **secret scan** (e.g., trufflehog) and **PII scan** (e.g., Presidio).
3. **Normalizer**: convert PDFs/Docs → Markdown; unify headings; generate stable `doc_id` (path‑based + content hash).
4. **Chunker**: token‑aware (e.g., 200–500 tokens, 50‑token overlap, keep headings with children).
5. **Embedder**: pin model/version; store `embedding_version`.
6. **Writer**: upsert metadata row, write blobs, upsert vectors in the right namespace(s).
7. **Tombstones** for deletes (don’t hard‑delete; mark `active=false` with `superseded_by`).

### Minimal repo layout

```
/kb
  /content              # canonical docs
    /global
    /project-foo
    /project-bar
  /glossary             # term ⇄ synonym maps
  /faq
  /schemas
    frontmatter.schema.json
  CODEOWNERS
  kb.rules.md           # contributor guide
```

**Frontmatter example**

```yaml
---
title: "OAuth Flow for Foo"
doc_id: "kb/oauth/foo"             # stable path id
version: "3.2.1"
owner: "team-auth"
projects: ["project-foo"]
tags: ["oauth","security","api"]
data_class: "internal"             # public | internal | restricted
effective_from: "2025-01-07"
supersedes: "kb/oauth/foo@3.2.0"
summary: "End-to-end OAuth sequence with PKCE."
---
```

### GitHub Action (sketch)

```yaml
name: KB Ingest
on:
  push: { branches: [main] }
  pull_request: {}
jobs:
  ingest:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      - run: pip install "kbtoolkit[all]"
      - name: Validate & Build
        run: kb validate && kb build  # schema, links, convert, chunk
      - name: Scan
        run: kb scan --secrets --pii
      - name: Emit Payload
        run: kb emit --to event.jsonl     # docs + chunks
      - name: Send to Ingest API
        run: curl -X POST $INGEST_URL -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
             -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @event.jsonl
```

### Knowledge API (contract snippets)

* **Search request**

```json
{
  "q": "rotate refresh token policy",
  "project": "project-foo",
  "namespaces": ["project-foo", "global"],
  "filters": {"data_class":"internal","tags":["oauth"]},
  "as_of": "2025-08-01",
  "top_k": 8,
  "rerank": true
}
```

* **Search response** returns chunks with `doc_id`, `version`, `score`, `highlights`, and a **canonical URL** you can show in citations inside any GPT.

### Multi‑project isolation

* **Namespaces**: one per project + `global`.
* **Row‑Level Security** in Postgres on metadata; API enforces the same filter for vector queries.
* **Policy**: queries must declare `project`, which sets allowed namespaces.

### Persistence & cumulative history

* Never delete; **supersede**.
* Retrieval defaults to **latest effective**; allow `as_of` for audits/time‑travel.
* Keep **embedding\_version** so you can re‑embed in the background without breaking serving.

### Guardrails (privacy & safety)

* **Data classes**: `public | internal | restricted`.
* **Restricted** never leaves your infra; optionally excluded from GPTs that don’t pass a policy check.
* Secret/PII scans block merges (COMP: BLOCKING).
* Access logs: who searched what and which chunks were returned (minimize retention).

### Evaluation (quality loop)

* **Golden set**: synthetic queries derived from headings and FAQs.
* Metrics: hit\@k, MRR, coverage per project, and a “wrong‑but‑confident” flag.
* Run nightly; if score drops, auto‑open a PR with diffs of impacted docs.

# “Two‑Week MVP” (testable)

**Week 1**

1. Create repo layout + schema + contributor guide.
2. Stand up Postgres (+pgvector), blob store, minimal FastAPI service.
3. Build ingestion worker (validate → chunk → embed → upsert).
4. Wire GitHub webhook for push/PR to ingestion.

**Week 2**
5\. Implement `/search` and `/doc/{id}@{ver}`, with namespaces + data\_class filtering.
6\. Add GitHub Action for CI checks; block on schema/PII/secrets.
7\. Plug one custom GPT via an **Action** to call `/search`.
8\. Seed glossary; run first retrieval eval; set baseline.

**Definition of Done**

* New PR to `/kb/content/project-foo` updates GPT answers within minutes.
* Search returns only allowed namespaces; citations open canonical docs.
* Eval dashboard shows ≥80% hit\@k on the golden set.

# Coaching Note

Once this backbone exists, adding a new GPT is boring in the best way: define its `project` namespace, hand it an Action spec, and it inherits the same governance, evals, and freshness. If you want extra spice later, add **learning cards**: short, curated chunks with few‑shot Q\&A to boost answer shape without leaking policy‑sensitive docs.

# Compliance & Quality Note

* Mark every doc with `data_class`. Treat **restricted** as non‑exportable and exclude it from GPT contexts unless the runtime identity is authenticated and authorized.
* Log retrievals, but **don’t** store user questions longer than necessary; segregate analytics.
* Pin embedding/model versions; record doc SHA and embedding hash for each chunk to keep audits crisp.

If you’d like, I can drop in a ready‑to‑use OpenAPI spec for the **Knowledge API** and a sample GitHub App webhook payload format so your team can scaffold immediately.
