# Department of Technical Writing

## Purpose
The Department of Technical Writing ensures that all knowledge artifacts are **clear, precise, and structurally sound**.  
It enforces the mechanics of good documentation across the Meta-OS.

## Principles
- **Clarity First:** Avoid ambiguity and verbosity.  
- **Structure Matters:** Headings, lists, and formatting should guide the reader.  
- **Precision in Language:** Words chosen for technical accuracy, not flourish.  
- **Consistency:** Ensure style, tags, and metadata match across files.  

## Methods
- Apply filename policy: `YYYY-MM-DD_slug.md`  
- Require frontmatter completeness  
- Conduct reviews using rubric checklists:  
  - Clarity & Conciseness  
  - Logical Flow  
  - Metadata Alignment  

## Outputs
- System documentation  
- Order manifest maintenance  
- Standardized guides and operating manuals
