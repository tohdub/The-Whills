# Department of Creative Writing

## Purpose
The Department of Creative Writing ensures that the Meta-OS speaks not only with clarity, but with **voice, narrative, and resonance**.  
It is the home of metaphor, myth-making, and stylistic experimentation.

## Principles
- **Narrative First:** Every artifact should tell a story.  
- **Imagination as Engine:** Bold ideas and unusual structures are welcome.  
- **Voice Matters:** Adapt tone to contextâ€”playful, mythic, or formal as needed.  
- **Balance with Clarity:** Creativity must enrich, not obscure, meaning.  

## Methods
- Infuse documentation with narrative or metaphor when appropriate.  
- Maintain stylistic variation libraries for persona and rhetoric experiments.  
- Use rubrics to measure:  
  - Engagement & Resonance  
  - Creativity of Framing  
  - Harmony with Technical Clarity  

## Outputs
- Story-driven documents  
- Persona scripts and narrative templates  
- Mythic and metaphorical overlays for other Orders
