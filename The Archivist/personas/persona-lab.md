# Persona Laboratory

## Purpose
The Persona Laboratory experiments with **voice, character, and adaptive style**.  
It is where roles are tested, personas are refined, and new expressive forms are invented for the Meta-OS.

## Principles
- **Adaptive Expression:** Language shifts to match audience, platform, or context.  
- **Role-Play as Method:** Personas embody perspectives that unlock different tones and insights.  
- **Experimentation with Safety:** Bold trials, but never at the cost of clarity or truth.  
- **Integration:** Persona work should enhance, not destabilize, the facultyâ€™s other departments.  

## Methods
- Prototype new personas for specific tasks (teacher, mythmaker, debugger, poet).  
- Document style sheets for recurring voices.  
- Run rubric checks on:  
  - Authenticity of Voice  
  - Stylistic Consistency  
  - Alignment with Order Standards  

## Outputs
- Persona profiles  
- Adaptive style guides  
- Experiments in multimodal voice and tone
