Here’s the **Guilds README rewritten in law-firm style** so it feels like a sharp consulting/legal practice (Harvey Specter energy) while still mapping cleanly to function. You can drop this straight in as `orders/the-guilds/README.md`.

# Guilds LLP — README

## Practice Charter

The Guilds are the **closers of the Meta-OS**. Where the Scribes document and the Geeks build, the Guilds execute. We take briefs, turn them into binding strategies, and ensure adoption in the world. Every engagement ends not with theory, but with precedent.

## Firm Structure

* **Managing Partner (Guildmaster):** Runs operations, assigns cases, escalates when necessary.
* **Senior Partner (Adoption Lead):** Owns “the client” (lived reality). Ensures solutions stick.
* **Chief Counsel (QA Foreman):** Reviews every case for acceptance gates (AG1–AG5) and narrative checkpoints (NC1–NC3). No sloppy filings pass this desk.
* **Knowledge Partner (Memory Steward):** Files case law. Maintains the archive of precedents and ensures cross-references to Scribes and Geeks.
* **Associates (Practice Guild Chairs + SMEs):** Draft integration plans, author playbooks, craft adapters.
* **Clerks (Journeymen & Apprentices):** Support with research, filings, and client follow-through.

## Case Flow

1. **Engagement Letter (Intake):** Brief arrives from the Scribes.
2. **Case Assignment (Triage):** Managing Partner routes to a Practice Guild.
3. **Case Strategy (Production):** Associates produce Integration Plan, Playbook, Adapters.
4. **Legal Review (QA):** Chief Counsel enforces AGs and NCs, escalating unclear cases to Whills or technical blockers to Geeks.
5. **Trial & Execution (Integration):** Senior Partner leads adoption in the client’s world.
6. **Precedent Filing (Memory):** Knowledge Partner records Adoption Report + Case File Record, linking to original briefs and tools.

## Deliverables

* **Engagement Letter** (brief confirmation)
* **Case Strategy Memo** (Integration Plan)
* **Precedent Binder** (Playbook + Adapters)
* **Client Adoption Report** (metrics & follow-through)
* **Case File Record** (persistent legend entry)

## Routing & Escalation

* Ambiguous briefs → Whills
* Tooling issues → Geeks
* Completed case files → Scribes for archival

## Nervous System Events (NDJSON)

* `intake.engagement`
* `case.submit`
* `review.verdict`
* `precedent.file`
* `memory.update`
* `memory.link`

## Culture

The Guilds LLP closes deals with precision and style. Every case strengthens the legend, every precedent makes the next win easier. We don’t just argue theory—we deliver verdicts that last.

Do you want me to also reframe the **persona markdowns** (Guildmaster, QA Foreman, etc.) into this *law firm voice* so they feel like firm roles instead of generic functions?
