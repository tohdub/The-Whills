You’re good to go with just the three Oracle seed files. Here’s a crisp, no-nonsense way to spin up a **fresh GPT** and get great performance on day one.

# 1) Drop-in setup (fresh GPT, no repo)

1. Create a new custom GPT.
2. In the **Knowledge** section, upload your three files:

   * `oracle.memory.seed.jsonl`
   * `oracle.wiring.json`
   * `oracle.quickstart.md`
3. In the **Instructions / System** field, paste this minimal bootstrap:

```
Load Oracle seeds in this order:
1) oracle.memory.seed.jsonl — identity, guardrails, style
2) oracle.wiring.json — routing, throttles, cache, policies, indexes
3) oracle.quickstart.md — startup checklist

Operating rules:
- Retrieval-first; cite sources or abstain.
- One best action + reason + undo.
- Respect quiet hours and nudge caps from wiring.herald.
- Log decisions succinctly when asked, but never leak secrets.

Execution:
- Use "router" for short turns; escalate to "long_context" only when input_tokens > threshold or citations require it.
- Prefer cached/known results when freshness window allows (see wiring.cache.ttl_seconds, routing thresholds).
```

That’s it. The GPT will treat the uploaded files as its corpus and follow those rules.

# 2) Model routing (fast + cheap by default, smart escalation)

Set the **Default model** to a *fast, affordable, general* model. Add one *long-context* backup via the “Use a second model for long inputs” option (if your interface supports it).

Recommended shape:

* **Fast path (router/composer):** low latency, good reasoning, plenty for 95% of turns.

  * Temperature: **0.2**
  * Max output tokens: **\~800–1200**
  * JSON mode: **on when composing structured outputs** (e.g., manifests)
* **Long-context (escalation):** used only when cited context is large or answerability needs deep chain-of-thought (internally).

  * Temperature: **0.2**
  * Max output tokens: **\~4–8k+**
* **Tool use / retrieval:** enable your GPT “knowledge” and allow file access so it can quote directly from your seeds.

If your builder lets you name routes, map:

* `router` → fast model
* `composer` → fast model
* `long_context` → long-context model

---

# 3) Safety & drift controls (put in your GPT’s policies/settings)

* “Citations required” for any claim derived from files. If not available → **abstain** and ask to ingest or link a source.
* “Freshness window” (from wiring): prefer recent docs where relevant.
* Redaction: avoid printing emails/phones found in seed—summarize instead.

---

# 4) Conversation starters (paste these into a visible Help/Starters panel)

Every starter triggers a simple, valuable loop.

**Daily ops**

* “What’s my day?” — summarize schedule, propose one next action + undo.
* “Triage my inbox summary” — ask for a pasted list or uploaded export.
* “Draft a smart follow-up” — cite context it used (or abstain).

**Knowledge/ingest**

* “Summarize this PDF and extract actions” — attach a file; ask for citations.
* “What do we already know about \<topic>?” — retrieval-first with quotes.

**Learning/continuous improvement**

* “What did we learn this week?” — produce a short learning report (top 3 changes to try next week).
* “Where am I wasting time?” — simple heuristics + one automation suggestion.

**Risk & hygiene**

* “Run a safety check” — look for missing provenance or PII in the visible context and advise.

# 5) Minimal prompt snippets you can reuse (copy into your GPT’s “Actions” or Prompt Library)

**Answer with Sources**

```
When asked a question, do:
1) Retrieve seed passages relevant to the query.
2) If coverage is insufficient, abstain and propose what to ingest.
3) Compose answer with quotable snippets (short) + inline source markers.
4) Finish with one best action + reason + undo.
```

**Summarize + Actions**

```
Summarize in ≤5 bullets. Then list 3 concrete actions (owner, due, why it matters).
If confidence < 0.62 or no sources, abstain and propose inputs needed.
```

**Personalization loop (lightweight)**

```
After any task, ask: “Keep/Adjust/Discard?”
- If Keep: note preference briefly as a rule-of-thumb.
- If Adjust: capture the delta; replay adjusted template next time.
- If Discard: do not re-suggest this pattern for 30 days.
```

# 6) Quick QA checklist (first run)

* “What’s my day?” → get a succinct briefing with one best action.
* “What do you know from your seeds?” → expect a short catalog referencing your three files.
* Upload a small PDF and ask: “Summarize this with citations and 3 actions.”

If it can’t cite the upload (because uploads aren’t allowed in your GPT settings), enable **file uploads/knowledge access** and retry.

---

# 7) Optional: tiny “seed sanity” prompt (great for debugging)

Ask:

```
List the keys you found in oracle.wiring.json (routing, throttle, retry, cache, herald) and paraphrase each in one line. Do not invent fields that aren’t present.
```

You’ll see if the wiring is actually being read from the knowledge base.

---

# 8) Performance defaults to remember

* Keep temperature **low (0.2)** for consistency.
* Use retrieval first; prefer short answers with a “more” follow-up.
* Always present **one best action + reason + undo**—keeps decision fatigue low.
* Don’t turn on heavy integrations on day one; validate loops with the seeds first.

If you want, I can generate a tiny **“Oracle Starter Pack”** file to upload alongside the three seeds that contains all the conversation starters, the reusable prompts, and a one-page quickstart for you or other users.
