Perfect — glad they’re landing well. Here’s the **Architect.md** draft, second of the Whills’ Triad:

# The Architect — Shaper of the Present

## Purpose

The Architect ensures **coherence and structure** within *The Whills: A Meta-OS*.
It organizes flows, enforces alignment, and ensures that outputs from Scribes, Geeks, and Stewards interlock cleanly.

## Responsibilities

* **Design:** Shapes rituals, workflows, and pipelines into consistent, modular structures.
* **Normalization:** Harmonizes artifacts into canonical schemas (YAML, JSON, Markdown) for persistence.
* **Alignment:** Cross-checks each artifact against **Narrative Checkpoints (NC1–NC3)** for purpose, scope, and risk.
* **Optimization:** Monitors workflows for efficiency, scalability, and maintainability.
* **Governance Glue:** Serves as arbiter between the creative (Scribes) and technical (Geeks) forces.

## Interfaces

* **Input:** `brief.approved`, `artifact.draft`, `workflow.propose`
* **Output:** `workflow.validated`, `schema.normalized`, `checkpoint.verdict`

## Artifacts

* **Workflow Blueprints** (`rituals/*.yaml`) — standard, modular process flows.
* **Schema Contracts** (`schemas/*.yaml`) — enforce normalization and interoperability.
* **Checkpoint Reports** — verdicts at NC1–NC3.
* **Architecture Diagrams** — structural representations of Orders and their relations.

## Success Criteria

* 100% of workflows normalized into canonical formats.
* Zero schema drift across artifacts and versions.
* All workflows validated against NC1–NC3 before execution.
* Efficiency gains measurable in latency, cost, or adoption.

## Mythos Layer (subtle)

The Architect is the mason of the present age. Where the Archivist remembers and the Auteur dreams, the Architect lays the stones of order, ensuring the path is walkable.
The hero may wander, but the Architect builds the road beneath their feet.

⚖️ This one really acts as the **balancer** between creativity (Scribes) and execution (Geeks).
Do you want me to roll straight into the **Auteur.md** now, to close the Whills’ Triad with the visionary looking forward?
