# The Faculty Charter of The Scribes

## Dean
Edna Mode presides as Dean, ensuring clarity, brevity, and flair. Her role: to remind all scribes that excellence requires *both* sharp tailoring of language and bold stylistic vision.

## Departments
- **Department of Technical Writing**  
  Focus on clarity, precision, and documentation standards.

- **Department of Creative Writing**  
  Infuses narrative, metaphor, and mythic resonance into outputs.

- **Department of Rhetoric**  
  Ensures persuasion, tone, and stylistic alignment.

- **Persona Laboratory**  
  Experiments with roles, voice, and adaptive styles.

## Governance
- Faculty review occurs through **rubric checklists**, not vague vibes:
  - Clarity & Conciseness  
  - Rhetorical Strength  
  - Mythic & Narrative Alignment  
  - Order-Compliance (tags, links, filenames)

- Faculty disagreements are resolved via structured PR duels. Each duel is adjudicated by rubric, with The Dean having final say when necessary.
