Amazing ðŸ™Œ glad you liked the Scribes!
Now letâ€™s move to the **Geeks â€” Order of Tools & Trials**. These are the engineers, tinkerers, and stress-testers. Again, Iâ€™ll keep it framework-serious, with subtle mythic undertones woven in.

# Geeks â€” Order of Tools & Trials

## Purpose

The Geeks are the forgers of the system â€” transforming the Scribesâ€™ specifications into working prototypes, tools, and workflows. They **arm the Hero** with the instruments required to cross through uncertainty and face the trials ahead.

In mythic terms, they embody **Tests, Allies, and Enemies** â€” the crucible where tools are proven, and weaknesses exposed.

---

## Form

* **Forge-Master (Coordination)**
  Oversees development cycles, prioritizes workloads, manages dependencies.

* **Engineers (Builders of Tools)**
  Implement workflows, scripts, and integrations based on the Scribesâ€™ documentation.

* **Testers (Trialmakers)**
  Stress-test prototypes, run edge-case scenarios, and simulate real-world risks.

* **Advisors (Allies of the Quest)**
  Suggest enhancements, alternative tools, or novel approaches to strengthen adoption.

---

## Function

1. **Intake** â†’ Receive validated specifications from The Scribes.
2. **Forge** â†’ Build tools, scripts, and workflows to fulfill documented requirements.
3. **Trial** â†’ Conduct stress tests, simulate failures, and validate robustness.
4. **Iteration** â†’ Refine solutions through feedback loops with Scribes and Stewards.
5. **Delivery** â†’ Handoff working artifacts to The Stewards for real-world integration.

---

## Artifacts

* **Prototype Toolchains** â€” working scripts, workflows, or adapters.
* **Test Logs** â€” results of trials, benchmarks, and simulations.
* **Forge Notes** â€” technical commentary, dependencies, and implementation details.
* **Validation Reports** â€” sign-offs on Acceptance Gates (AG4â€“AG5).

---

## Routing & Escalation

* **Spec ambiguity** â†’ Returned to Scribes.
* **Domain adoption blockers** â†’ Routed early to Stewards.
* **Tool risks or governance issues** â†’ Escalated to The Whills.

---

## Nervous System Events (NDJSON)

* `geek.intake.spec`
* `geek.forge.prototype`
* `geek.test.trial`
* `geek.iterate.refine`
* `geek.deliver.tool`

---

## Governance Alignment

* **Acceptance Gates**: AG4 (Normalization), AG5 (Validation).
* **Narrative Checkpoints**: NC3 (Risk visibility).

---

## Subtle Mythos Note

The Geeks are not simply engineers. In the legend, they are the **blacksmiths of destiny** â€” those who test the Heroâ€™s blade in fire and strike it until it sings. Their tools may look ordinary, but each carries the weight of a thousand unseen trials.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to draft the **Stewards â€” Order of Domains** next (the integration/adoption layer), so youâ€™ll have the full operational pipeline in matched form?
