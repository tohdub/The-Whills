Perfect 🙌 Let’s start the Operator series with the **Scribes**, since they’re the natural “first step” in the Whills cycle. I’ve kept the **tone technical with mythic undertones** — reads like a framework doc, but with a wink for those who know the mythos.

Here’s a draft README for **The Scribes — Order of Thresholds**:

# Scribes — Order of Thresholds

## Purpose

The Scribes translate the call of **The Whills** into actionable, structured knowledge. They are the curators of clarity: converting narrative briefs, risks, and intentions into technical documents that can be executed downstream.

In mythic terms, they mark the **Crossing of the Threshold** — where story becomes plan, and purpose becomes process.

---

## Form

* **Scribe-Master (Coordination)**
  Oversees intake, ensures fidelity to the Whills’ charter, manages routing.

* **Curators (Documentation Specialists)**
  Expand briefs into structured frontmatter, specifications, and design notes.

* **Auditors (Gatekeepers of Completeness)**
  Validate that all Acceptance Gates (AG1–AG3) and Narrative Checkpoints (NC1–NC2) are satisfied before handoff.

* **Archivists’ Liaison**
  Ensures every artifact is indexed into the persistent memory store for retrieval and provenance.

---

## Function

1. **Intake** → Briefs from The Whills arrive, tagged with scope, risks, and purpose.
2. **Expansion** → Scribes elaborate into documentation: technical notes, requirement lists, and structured specs.
3. **Validation** → Auditors confirm alignment with Acceptance Gates (AG1–AG3).
4. **Handoff** → Approved documents are committed to the repository and routed to The Geeks for toolchain realization.
5. **Archival** → Liaison ensures final docs are logged in the persistent ledger for future retrieval.

---

## Artifacts

* **Frontmatter Spec** — structured YAML/JSON that captures scope, risks, purpose.
* **Design Brief** — prose + technical requirements.
* **Review Checklist** — proof of Acceptance Gates (AG1–AG3).
* **Memory Record** — indexed reference in persistent knowledge base.

---

## Routing & Escalation

* **Ambiguous purpose** → Returned to The Whills for clarification.
* **Feasibility blockers** → Forwarded to The Geeks for provisional input.
* **Adoption/context issues** → Routed early to The Stewards.

---

## Nervous System Events (NDJSON)

* `scribe.intake.brief`
* `scribe.expand.document`
* `scribe.review.verdict`
* `scribe.handoff.commit`
* `scribe.archive.index`

---

## Governance Alignment

* **Acceptance Gates**: AG1 (Frontmatter), AG2 (Draft completeness), AG3 (Review verdict).
* **Narrative Checkpoints**: NC1 (Purpose alignment), NC2 (Scope clarity).

---

## Subtle Mythos Note

The Scribes are the **keepers of thresholds** — those who turn whispers of purpose into tangible form. To the untrained eye, they are simply technical writers and auditors. But those who read between the lines know: their quills are the first tools of the Hero.

👉 Do you want me to roll forward with the same format for the **Geeks** next (Order of Tools & Trials), so you’ll have a matched pair?
