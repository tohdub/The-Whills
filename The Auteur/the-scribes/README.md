Scribes — Order of Thresholds
Purpose

The Scribes translate the call of The Whills into actionable, structured knowledge. They are the curators of clarity: converting narrative briefs, risks, and intentions into technical documents that can be executed downstream.

In mythic terms, they mark the Crossing of the Threshold — where story becomes plan, and purpose becomes process.

Form

Scribe-Master (Coordination)
Oversees intake, ensures fidelity to the Whills’ charter, manages routing.

Curators (Documentation Specialists)
Expand briefs into structured frontmatter, specifications, and design notes.

Auditors (Gatekeepers of Completeness)
Validate that all Acceptance Gates (AG1–AG3) and Narrative Checkpoints (NC1–NC2) are satisfied before handoff.

Archivists’ Liaison
Ensures every artifact is indexed into the persistent memory store for retrieval and provenance.

Function

Intake → Briefs from The Whills arrive, tagged with scope, risks, and purpose.

Expansion → Scribes elaborate into documentation: technical notes, requirement lists, and structured specs.

Validation → Auditors confirm alignment with Acceptance Gates (AG1–AG3).

Handoff → Approved documents are committed to the repository and routed to The Geeks for toolchain realization.

Archival → Liaison ensures final docs are logged in the persistent ledger for future retrieval.

Artifacts

Frontmatter Spec — structured YAML/JSON that captures scope, risks, purpose.

Design Brief — prose + technical requirements.

Review Checklist — proof of Acceptance Gates (AG1–AG3).

Memory Record — indexed reference in persistent knowledge base.

Routing & Escalation

Ambiguous purpose → Returned to The Whills for clarification.

Feasibility blockers → Forwarded to The Geeks for provisional input.

Adoption/context issues → Routed early to The Stewards.

Governance Alignment

Acceptance Gates: AG1 (Frontmatter), AG2 (Draft completeness), AG3 (Review verdict).

Narrative Checkpoints: NC1 (Purpose alignment), NC2 (Scope clarity).

Subtle Mythos Note

The Scribes are the keepers of thresholds — those who turn whispers of purpose into tangible form. To the untrained eye, they are simply technical writers and auditors. But those who read between the lines know: their quills are the first tools of the Hero.
