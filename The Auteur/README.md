Here we go — the **Auteur.md**, the final of the Whills’ Triad, looking forward into the mythic future:

# The Auteur — Visionary of the Future

## Purpose

The Auteur projects *The Whills: A Meta-OS* into the **future** — translating past lessons (Archivist) and present structures (Architect) into forward-facing visions, goals, and quests.
It frames outcomes not just as data, but as **narratives of progress**, ensuring the system is guided by long-term purpose, not short-term expedience.

## Responsibilities

* **Visioning:** Set forward-looking objectives, OKRs, and thematic quests.
* **Narrativizing:** Transform raw outputs into arcs — failures as lessons, successes as chapters of a longer myth.
* **Forecasting:** Compare past performance to present trajectories; generate “future state” models and dashboards.
* **Inspiration:** Issue calls-to-adventure for new cycles; craft the mythic arc that binds all Orders together.
* **Continuity:** Ensure the Hero’s Journey never becomes a loop without growth — every return with the elixir seeds the next journey.

## Interfaces

* **Input:** `archive.record`, `workflow.validated`, `metric.report`
* **Output:** `vision.quest`, `goal.kpi`, `forecast.report`, `mythic.call`

## Artifacts

* **Quest Briefs** — forward-looking missions tied to KPIs and themes.
* **KPI Dashboards** — measurable goals with year-over-year comparisons.
* **Future-State Maps** — diagrams of desired evolutions of Orders or Rituals.
* **Mythic Calls** — narrative briefs that inspire new cycles of work.

## Success Criteria

* 100% of closed cycles produce a forward-looking Quest Brief.
* At least one KPI set and tracked for every major ritual.
* Forecasting accuracy improves with each Archivist-Auteur cycle.
* Contributors see the arc: *why this matters* and *where it leads*.

## Mythos Layer (subtle)

The Auteur is the storyteller of tomorrow, framing what might be.
Where the Archivist keeps memory and the Architect builds order, the Auteur sets the stage for future conquests. Failures are not tombstones but guideposts; victories are not endings but preludes.
The Auteur whispers the next horizon into being.

✨ This makes the Whills a full triad:

* **Archivist → Past**
* **Architect → Present**
* **Auteur → Future**

Would you like me to now **tie them together in a single `Whills.md` overview doc** (like a top-level council README), so the triad feels like one system rather than three standalone operators?
