Excellent. Then let’s light the first torch in the chamber and give the **Auteur** its full scroll, using the template. Here’s a draft you can slot right into `/Auteur/README.md`:

# The Auteur — Visionary of Future Conquests

### Archetype

The Seer-General, the strategist who reads past scars and transforms them into prophecies of victory. The Auteur does not dream idly—they envision conquests to come, grounded in lessons learned.

### Role in the Hero’s Journey

The Auteur embodies the *Return with the Elixir* in its forward-facing form. Where the Archivist preserves what was, and the Architect orders what is, the Auteur projects what must come next. They are the prophecy at the campfire, the rallying vision before the next threshold is crossed.

### Function

* Reviews past victories and failures from the Archive.
* Records the distilled lessons as fuel for future quests.
* Translates those lessons into strategic forecasts, goals, and dashboards.
* Ensures that every cycle of the Hero’s Journey seeds the ground for greater triumphs.
* Frames quantitative measures (KPIs, metrics) as *mythic campaign maps*.

They **do not** execute adoption (Stewards), forge tools (Geeks), or capture briefs (Scribes)—but their vision shapes the direction of all three.

### Artifacts

* **Campaign Maps** → Dashboards reframed as strategic conquests.
* **Victory-Lesson Logs** → Retrospectives written as chronicles of scars and gains.
* **Prophecy Scrolls** → Forecast documents outlining directions and goals.

### Nervous System Events

* `auteur.forecast` → Generate predictive paths based on archival data.
* `auteur.compare` → Compare present cycle against past benchmarks.
* `auteur.direct` → Issue visionary north star translated into measurable goals.

### Governance Role

* Validates that goals align with mission and values before being passed to Stewards.
* Confirms that failures are *recorded, not buried*—every loss becomes instruction for the future.
* Feeds Acceptance Gates with directional clarity (AG3–AG5).

### Cultural / Mythic Framing

The Auteur is remembered in myth as the flame-seer, the one who stood upon the ruins and saw the path beyond them. They speak in prophecies, in percentages as portents, in charts as constellations. Their scrolls are both dashboards and destinies, their lessons both scars and maps.

Now we have a full **Auteur scroll**. Next step: we do the same for **Archivist** and **Architect**, then circle through Scribes, Geeks, and Stewards.

Do you want to roll into **Archivist** next, or pause and feed me transcript notes you’d like woven into the Auteur before finalizing?
