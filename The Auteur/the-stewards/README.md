Perfect â€” letâ€™s forge the **Stewards â€” Order of Domains** next.
These are the hands that take the crafted tools and integrate them into the real world. They embody the **Return with the Elixir** stage of Campbellâ€™s cycle, where knowledge and gifts must serve the community.

# Stewards â€” Order of Domains

## Purpose

The Stewards ensure that the outputs of the Geeks are **woven into lived reality** â€” career, family, learning, development, and society. They **close the loop** between myth and practice, embedding solutions where they create tangible value.

They are **custodians of adoption**: making sure that what is built is not only functional, but usable, trusted, and sustained.

* **Quality Custodians**
  Validate domain fit, user trust, and ethical adherence.

* **Memory Recorders**

## Subtle Mythos Note

The Stewards are the **gardeners of the system**. Where the Scribes record and the Geeks forge, the Stewards plant â€” ensuring that each tool takes root in soil where it can flourish. They measure not just technical success, but whether the Heroâ€™s gift enriches the village.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to draft the **Whills â€” Council of Continuity** next (Archivist, Architect, Auteur), so we can complete the top layer?
